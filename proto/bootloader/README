The particular version of the bootloader used comes out of the file:
http://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/22787/HolgerBootloader10.zip

This was contributed as part of http://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/67047.
According to the author the code is only 1580 bytes and so should easily
pass in the boot sector of the butterfly, once this has been defined to
encompass 1024 words (2048 bytes).

This version probably only supports FAT16 formatted SD cards.

An article was written about flashing an updated firmware from the
bootloader here: http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/MMC/SD_Bootloader_f%C3%BCr_AT_Mega
